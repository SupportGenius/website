#     tools/deploy.sh             build origin/main in a throwaway worktree, deploy it
#     tools/deploy.sh --dry-run   build it and say what would ship, deploy nothing
#
# Why not `build-dist.sh && wrangler pages deploy dist` from wherever you are:
# that ships the contents of a working copy, and a working copy is shared state.
# More than one agent can work in the same checkout at once. Deploying from it
# can publish another session's uncommitted edits, or a checkout that is behind
# main and quietly rolls back work that was merged minutes ago.
#
# So this never reads the caller's working tree or its dist/. It fetches,
# checks origin/main out into a temporary worktree, checks and builds there,
# deploys that, and removes it. What goes live is always a commit that is on
# main, and the Pages deployment records which one.
